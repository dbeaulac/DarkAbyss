# Dark Abyss

Coded in C Sharp and created with Unity, this game was a project that I programmed (with graphics assistance from EJ Gillis) as a final project for the Game Design Workshop class (GAME 3000) at Fitchburg State University in Spring 2016.

Dark Abyss, is a puzzle game that is based on Pipe Dream; a game created in the late 1980s, whose concept has been popularly implemented into various games as a mini game.

The goal of Dark Abyss is to save groups of miners by creating a path for them to navigate from one point to another.

## Controls
- The arrow keys (or WASD keys) move the cursor on the grid.
- The space bar places the current piece on the grid.
- The control key, when held, allows the miners to move at 2x speed.
- The Enter key pauses and unpauses the game.

## Launching the game
The game can be played by launching the executable in the top level directory. The game is optimized for a 16:9 resolution (such as 1280x720), and isn't playable on other resolutions (anything less than 16:9 will result in the edges of the screen being cut off).
